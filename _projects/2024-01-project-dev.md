In January 2022, I start teaching the __Project Development course__ of the __Master in Data Science__ at __[UDG](https://www.udg.mx/en/inicio)__. I took this as a Medium-term personal project and, after two years of inherit this course, I selected different data science material and tools for the students to learn and use it for future projects and, in some cases, for their thesis. These material includes collaborative yhe use of version control software __GitHub__, an overview of Markdown and User Interface commands, perform __EDA__ and use tools for web scraping, interactive graphics, text analysis, wordclouds and maps with Python.

## Project Development course
In the second semester of 2021 I was invited to present my personal project *"Choosing a baby name using Python"* in a webinar organized by the managers of the [Master in Data Science](https://mcd.cucea.udg.mx) program at Universidad de Guadalagara (UDG). After this event, I was invited to collaborate in the program giving a course related to project management and development.

I start teaching the Project Development course on January 2022, using mainly the material teached by the previous professor of Risk Management from the Project Management Institute (PMI) and simulation wit '@Risk'. However, I also had the oportunity to add material and tools that I believe it could be useful for the students.

In almost two years, since I start teaching this course in January 2022 until December 2023, the material has evolved and change completely from what I inherited. In the last version of the course, I focused on working with open-source tools for collaborative version control software (*GitHub* and *Git*), an overview of *Markdown* and *User Interface* commands, developed an exploratory data analysis (EDA), and other tools for web scraping, interactive graphics, text analysis, wordclouds and use maps with Python.
