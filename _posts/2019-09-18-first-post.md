Opportunity cost is what brought me to Vancouver last August, and probably to the most MDS students.  

I hear about Data Science around 2014 while, as a student in [NC State](https://www.ncsu.edu) I met Miguel. He told me about his cool program in Analytics that was just about to finish, one of the first programs in Data Science.  

I returned to Mexico, and I worked for 5 years as a researcher in the Central Bank. However, after taking some courses in Data Mining, I got interested in learn this field in a deeper way. This thought danced on my head for a couple years. It took me another year to convince my lovely wife, Pam, and to apply for the UBC program.  

We arrived on August 26th, it was a chilly and sunny morning, the first of many in Vancity. I knew this was the wright path.
