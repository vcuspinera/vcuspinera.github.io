Opportunity cost was what bring me to Vancouver last August, and probably to the most MDSâ€™s classmates.  

I hear about Data Science around 2014, while as a student in North Carolina State I met Miguel. He told me about this cool program that he was just about to finish: Analytics, the predecessor of Data Science programs.  

I returned to Mexico, and I worked as a researcher for the government for 5 years. However, after taking some courses in Data Mining, I got interested in learn this field in a deeper way. This thought danced on the top of my head for a couple years, and it also took me another year to convince Pam, my wife, and to apply for the UBC program.  

We arrived on August 26th, it was a chilly and sunny morning, the first of many in Vancity. I knew this was the wright path.
