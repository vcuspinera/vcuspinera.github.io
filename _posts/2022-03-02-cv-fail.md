## __About this document__
This is the CV of my failures. I heard of this from Mike Gelbart, [look here](https://www.mikegelbart.com/files/cv.pdf).

Success tends to be more visible than failures, and this attempt to bring in some balance. In my case, I have been perseverant with my aims, but I have fall over several times in the way. This document includes my academic and professional failures sitting in early-2022, and probably missed some of them.
