My name is Victor Hugo as the [French writter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo). I grew up in the East Coast of Mexico and, as a consecuence, I like Pina Colada, getting caught in the warm rain, and the sound of the ocean.

I have studied in the three countries that celebrate the [NAFTA Agreement (nowadays USMCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States–Mexico–Canada_Agreement): Data Science in Canada, Economics in the U.S., and Actuarial Science in Mexico. Also, I have experience as Analyst and Researcher in the [Central Bank of Mexico.](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html)

I learn from my grandfather to be kind and perseverant, always. When I am stress, thoughtful, happy or sad, I really enjoy cooking. I am interested in the crossover between Economy and Arts. And nothing relaxes me more than swimming.

I am happy to share my tougths and personal projects. Feel free to drop me a line anytime.
