My name is Victor Hugo as [the French writter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo). I grew up in the West Coast of Mexico and, as result, I like the sound of the ocean and getting caught in the warm rain.

I have studied in the three countries that celebrate the [NAFTA (nowadays USMCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States–Mexico–Canada_Agreement): Actuarial Science in Mexico, Economics in the U.S.A., and Data Science in Canada. Also, I have experience as Analyst and Researcher in the [Central Bank of Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html).

I learn from my grandfather to be kind and perseverant, always. When I am stress, thoughtful, happy or sad, I really enjoy to cook. I am interested in the crossover between Economy and Arts. And nothing relaxes me more than swimming.
