My name is Victor Hugo, as the [french writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo). I grew up in the East Coast of Mexico and, as a consequence, I like Pina Colada, getting caught in the warm rain, and the sound of the ocean.

I come from very diverse backgrounds, while the family of my mother comes from the Maya's ethnic group, my father's family origin is from Spain and Ireland. I was always close to my grandfather who was born in Izamal, a little town in Yucatan's Peninsula. He was always kind and perseverant, two qualities that I have always try to follow and that have been important for my own development along my life.

I studied in the three [NAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States–Mexico–Canada_Agreement) countries: Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. I earn a Bachelor in Actuarial Science at [Universidad de las Americas Puebla](https://www.udlap.mx/ofertaacademica/Default.aspx?cveCarrera=LAT&idioma=2) (Mexico) because of my passion for mathematics. After five years of experience in [Banco de Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html), I realize the importance of learning Economics as a complement of Statistics and Finances, so in 2014 started the Master in Economics in [North Carolina State University](https://poole.ncsu.edu/gradecon/). Afterwards, while working as Researcher in the Mexican Central Bank, I realize the importance of handling and working with big data, so I got the support of my employer for studying a Master in Data Science, in 2019 at [the University of British Columbia](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca).

Something personal is that when I am stressed, thoughtful, happy or sad, I really enjoy cooking. I am also interested in the crossover between Economy and Arts. And nothing relaxes me more than swimming.

I am happy to share my tougths and personal projects. Feel free to drop me a line anytime.
