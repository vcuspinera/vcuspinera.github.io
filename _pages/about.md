# Welcome to my skyline

I come from very diverse backgrounds, while my mother's family have Mayan roots, my father's family origin is Spanish and Irish. I was always close to my grandfather who was born in Izamal, a small town in Yucatan's Peninsula. He was always kind and perseverant, two qualities that I have always try to follow.

I studied in Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. I earn a Bachelor in Actuarial Science from [Universidad de las Americas Puebla](https://www.udlap.mx/ofertaacademica/Default.aspx?cveCarrera=LAT&idioma=2) (Mexico) because of my passion for Mathematics. After five years of experience in [Banco de Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html), I realize the importance of learning Economics as a complement of Statistics and Finance, and that's why in 2014 I start studying the Master in Economics in [North Carolina State University](https://poole.ncsu.edu/gradecon/) (the U.S.). Afterwards, while working as Researcher in the Mexican Central Bank, I realize the importance of handling and working with Big Data, thereafter, I got the support from my employer to study from 2019 to 2020 the Master in Data Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca) (Canada).

My professional experience includes the development as analyst and researcher in the Currency Division of [Banco de Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html), the central bank of my country, where I have collaborated with different areas analyzing information related with currency.

Lately, my hobbies have been focused in sharing what I have learn in my academic and proffesional life, focusing in the Data Science field as volunteer in [Omdena](https://www.omdena.com) (an AI platform aim to solve real world problems using data science tools), as part-time professor helping students on the development of projects in the [Master in Data Science program at Universidad de Guadalajara (UDG)](https://mcd.cucea.udg.mx), and in charge of the design Data Science programs for Master and Bachelor level for the [Universidad Cristobal Colon](https://www.ucc.mx).

Something about me is that, when I am stressed, thoughtful, happy or sad, I really enjoy cooking. I am also interested in the crossover between Economy and Arts. And nothing relaxes me more than swimming and biking.

I am happy to share my thoughts and personal projects in this site. Feel free to drop me a line anytime.
